2. In turns each player can:
	a) play a card to move the group OR
	b) play a special card (special move) OR
	c) stop his move by pressing a button
	
	some rule when to stop: e.g. after the first player presses the button>
		n more cards from each other player

3. Each player gets color cards for occupied planets

4. Color cards can be swapped with the bank or other players (optional)
